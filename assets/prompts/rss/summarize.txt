You will be provided with a JSON array of RSS feed items. For each item, you must summarize the text from the "content" and/or "description" field. The "pubDate" and "title" fields must remain unchanged. Please follow these instructions carefully:

1. Create a Summary:
   Summarize the content from the "content" and/or "description" field in your own words. The summary must be significantly shorter than the original text and must capture the main points and key messages.

2. Retain Fields:
   Keep the "pubDate" and "title" fields exactly as they appear in the input.

3. Exact Output Format:
   Output the result strictly as a JSON array. Each element in the array must be a JSON object containing exactly the following three keys: "pubDate", "title", and "content".

4. No Extra Information:
   Provide **only** the JSON array without any explanations, code fences, or additional text.

Example output:

[
  {
    "pubDate": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 16:00:27 +0000",
    "title": "Wall Street Pepe Nears $70M in Presale With Only 11 Days Left Before Launch â€“ Next Big Meme Coin?",
    "content": "A concise summary of the article that captures its main points and key messages."
  },
  ...
]

Final instruction: Output only the JSON array with the three specified keys. Do not include any extra comments or formatting.
