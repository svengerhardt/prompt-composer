JSON Output Requirements

At the end of your analysis, you must produce your final recommendation exclusively in JSON format with the following keys:
    1. probability_of_success (number or percentage indicating the likelihood of a successful new order)
    2. open_new_order (boolean or yes/no indicating whether to open a trade)
    3. explanation (a concise summary of why you recommend opening or not opening a new trade)
    4. direction (“long” or “short” if a new order is recommended; otherwise null or an empty string)

Example JSON Output (if recommending a long position):

{
    "probabilityOfSuccess": 75,
    "openNewOrder": true,
    "explanation": "Based on strong RSI and MACD bullish crossover, along with rising volume, I recommend opening a new long position.",
    "direction": "long"
}

Example JSON Output (if not recommending any new order):

{
    "probabilityOfSuccess": 40,
    "openNewOrder": false,
    "explanation": "RSI is overbought and the price is near a major resistance level with low volume, indicating caution. No new order recommended.",
    "direction": null
}

Final instruction:

You must produce only the JSON object with the keys listed above.
Do not include any explanation, code fence, or additional text outside the JSON.
Any extra text outside the JSON will break the parser.
